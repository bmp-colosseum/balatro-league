        {/* ============================ SHOP QUEUE ============================ */}
        <Section id="shop-queue" title="The shop queue">
          <p>
            The single most important thing to understand about MP: <strong>the shop is deterministic
            and queue-based.</strong> Both players draw from the same predefined sequences, so the
            <em> order</em> you see, buy, block, and skip things changes what comes next — and what your
            opponent sees too. There are three independent parts of the shop, each with its own queue:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Main shop</strong> — the rerollable part: jokers, tarots, planets, spectrals (Ghost Deck), and playing cards (Magic Trick).</li>
            <li><strong>Pack</strong> portion — the two booster packs.</li>
            <li><strong>Voucher</strong> portion.</li>
          </ul>

          <SubHeading>Part 1 — the main shop queue</SubHeading>
          <p>
            The main shop is one master queue made of <strong>7 sub-queues</strong>. Five are always
            active; two are conditional:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Common joker queue</li>
            <li>Uncommon joker queue</li>
            <li>Rare joker queue</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Up Top&rdquo; tarot queue</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Up Top&rdquo; planet queue</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Up Top&rdquo; spectral queue <span className="muted">(only surfaces on Ghost Deck)</span></li>
            <li>Playing-card queue <span className="muted">(only with the Magic Trick voucher)</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Every new shop or reroll advances the master queue. Each slot in the master queue points at
            a <em>type</em> (e.g. &ldquo;common joker&rdquo;, &ldquo;spectral&rdquo;); when it comes up, the next item from
            that sub-queue is revealed. So the shop is really &ldquo;take the next item of whatever type the
            master queue says next.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <Callout title="Worked example">
            <p>
              Suppose the master queue reads (CJ = common joker, RJ = rare, T = tarot, P = planet,
              S = spectral, C = playing card), and each sub-queue holds the items shown. On Ghost Deck,
              the shop reads off the top of whatever queue each slot points to:
            </p>
            <QueueExample
              cols={[
                { type: "CJ", item: "Jimbo", sprite: "j_joker" },
                { type: "CJ", item: "Raised Fist", sprite: "j_raised_fist" },
                { type: "S", item: "Hex", note: "Ghost only", sprite: "c_hex" },
                { type: "RJ", item: "Blueprint", sprite: "j_blueprint" },
                { type: "T", item: "The Fool", sprite: "c_fool" },
                { type: "C", item: "A♥" },
                { type: "P", item: "Pluto", sprite: "c_pluto" },
                { type: "S", item: "Ankh", note: "Ghost only", sprite: "c_ankh" },
              ]}
            />
            <p style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
              The 3rd slot is a spectral — <em>on Ghost Deck</em> you see a <strong>Hex</strong>; on any
              other deck that slot is skipped and the queue progresses straight to the rare,{" "}
              <strong>Blueprint</strong>.
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <p style={{ marginTop: 14 }}>
            <strong>Blocking shifts the queue.</strong> If something can&apos;t appear — you blocked it, or
            it&apos;s a planet for a hand you haven&apos;t unlocked — that sub-queue simply skips to its next
            item. Roll into an Eris you haven&apos;t unlocked and you get the next planet (Mars) instead.
            Because the playing-card queue only advances when you actually <em>see</em> it, not buying
            Magic Trick means you never consume those entries — they wait for when you do.
          </p>

          <SubHeading>Part 2 — &ldquo;Up Top&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Pack&rdquo; queues</SubHeading>
          <p>
            For tarots, spectrals, and planets there are actually <strong>two</strong> separate queues each:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Up Top</strong> — every consumable created <em>outside</em> a pack (shop slot, jokers like Seance, Purple Seals, Speedrun, etc.) pulls from here.</li>
            <li><strong>Pack</strong> — only progresses when you open a pack of that type.</li>
          </ul>
          <Callout title="Soul &amp; Black Hole">
            <p>
              The Soul (and Black Hole) have their own game-long queue of mostly misses. Every consumable
              created when you open a tarot/spectral pack rolls the Soul queue; on a hit, the consumable
              queue is pushed back one and the Soul is inserted. In practice: open a Mega Arcana Pack and
              successfully <em>tarot-block twice</em> and the Soul appears among your options. So holding
              the right tarots can be the difference between seeing the Soul or not.
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <SubHeading>The packs queue</SubHeading>
          <p>
            Separately from the per-type pack queues, there is a single game-long <strong>&ldquo;packs&rdquo; queue</strong>
            {" "}— the sequence of which <em>boosters</em> appear. It only advances when you see shops. The
            payoff: <strong>skipping a blind doesn&apos;t cost you packs.</strong> If you skip a shop and your
            opponent doesn&apos;t, you&apos;ll just see those same packs one blind later than they did.
          </p>

          <SubHeading>Part 3 — the voucher queue</SubHeading>
          <p>
            The voucher queue is a game-long list of numbers <strong>1–16</strong> (yes — even though there
            are 32 vouchers). Each entry tries to spawn the matching <strong>Tier 1</strong> voucher; if you
            already bought it, the <strong>Tier 2</strong> spawns instead; if you own both, the queue skips
            ahead and repeats. Voucher tags advance this queue the same way seeing a new ante does — except
            if two identical vouchers would appear back-to-back, the second is skipped.

              <code> Ok · Break · Ok · Break · …</code>, then in a hand the 1st glass card to score is &ldquo;ok&rdquo;,

              Idol sorts your deck from the cards you have the <strong>most</strong> duplicates of to the
              fewest (ties broken by suit, then rank; Ace is low), then rolls <strong>1–1000</strong> and
              selects a card by that position. Crucially, <em>both players roll the same number</em> — so
              the better-stacked your deck, the more reliably Idol hits your most-common card.

              This lets you read your opponent: if your Idol hits your most-common card, your nemesis&apos;s

              missed unless their deck is perfectly stacked.

              Reworked to cut variance between players. On sell, each joker is given a position by type

              If both players hold the same jokers, Invisible copies the same one. If player 1 has one

              one and otherwise copies what player 2 copies. Adding a joker can only ever change the pick
